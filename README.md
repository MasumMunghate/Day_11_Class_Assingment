# Day_11_Class_Assingment

The document.addEventListener("keydown", function) listens for a key press event.

Inside the event listener function, you get the pressed key's name using e.key and the key's code using e.keyCode.

The line document.getElementById("heading").style.display = "none"; hides the "Press Any Key" heading.

You change the content of the <h3> element and <span> element with IDs "h3" and "key_name" to show "You Pressed" and the pressed key's name.

The content of the <span> element with the ID "key_Number" is set to show the key's number.

If the pressed key's code is 32 (which corresponds to the space key), you change the text content to say "Space".
